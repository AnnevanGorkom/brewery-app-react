## Brewery overview
The idea is that at first you see the full list of breweries. Each brewery has it's own card. Above the first card there will be a filter for countries. If one of the countries is chosen, the user will only see the brewery cards of the breweries that have one or more locations in that country. The data that is shown in the screenshot above can eventually be enriched with extra data.

## Search
The search functionality should return relevant data to the search. This can be a brewery, a beer, etc.
